	The  c project  that I have developed  is  for the Bus Reservation  which is one of the real time applications.
 Initially I have made the code to  know the purpose of the customer(to enquire or to both enquire and book).Accordingly,
 the code is executed. For enquiry, the  number of buses  that  the agency is running and   details like timings, available
 seats ,cost of each ticket  etc are printed to the customer  according to their options. This gives a complete view to the
 customer who enquires for it.
 	
	

	Next, the details from the user for reservation is done where the name, age, gender, date, month, year of their 
travelling ,timing of the bus, Number of persons travelling ,type of bus (  seater or semi sleeper)  are taken which are 
considered to be essential. Here the code prints for the valid timings available for them. Then it shows the cost of the 
tickets according to the stoppings preferred by the customer(as payments may differ for different stoppings).Then  the code 
asks to specify the no. of seats in the available routes according to which the cost is printed at last. Next, it allows  
the customer to book the seat numbers(only to the available seats) according to their wish and here the seat list is shown to 
them to have a overview.( regarding the booked seats where the booked seats are indicated by ‘0’). Finally the receipt 
containing the name, age, gender(for each person),total cost of their  tickets and the booked seats are printed for the customer. 
If the customer wishes ,the booking can be made once again with another set of data( another booking) or  he/she can exit the page.
 Thus, the Bus Reservation System is done successfully.
